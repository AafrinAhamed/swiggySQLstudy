I am sharing my study on swiggy dataset from two cities with nearly 50k valid real time data
Hi folks! Just Completed My SQL Study with Real-world Data! Solving Swiggy dataset has been an incredible learning journey! 
I framed and solve nearly 25 challenging questions. These questions ranged from optimizing the order of writing code, efficiently arranging and limiting data, to mastering the art of using joins.
Here are some key takeaways from my experience:
Order of Writing Code: One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is the significance of the order in which SQL code is written. It's a critical factor in performance optimization and maintaining clean, readable queries.
Arranging and Limiting Data: Properly arranging and limiting data is essential for effective data analysis. To collect only top or bottom line data LIMITS is more important. Also OFFSET helps in getting the 2nd greatest or least.
Using Joins: Joins are the backbone of SQL, and mastering them can unlock a wealth of insights from your datasets. I've explored various join types, their applications, and learned how to combine data from different tables effectively.
